## Theme development: ##
 Pycharm IDE
* VVV Vagrant Development environment
* GitHub

I have used an excellent WordPress to develop a child theme on the website by AxiomThemes
For further changes, the child theme is located here: wp-content\themes\crework-child 
and parent theme here: wp-content\themes\crework-parent

## Styling: ##
I have added SASS to the WordPress child theme. I have used VS code as it supports SASS development. I then created File watcher so it detects for the changes in the SASS file and changes the output CSS automatically. I modified parent's theme to style the website according to the requirements provided by client.

## Coloring ##
According to the client's requirements, I was asked to use pale turquoise, blues and sage greens as on the logo provided by the client. along with a white background with no bright colours.
 
## Deployment: ##
**Vagrant**
I have used Vagrant VVV as my local deployment environment to develop the wordpress website and child theme
