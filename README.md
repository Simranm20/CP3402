Theme development:
Pycharm IDE
VVV Vagrant Development environment
GitHub
I have used an excellent WordPress child theme to develop the website by AxiomThemes
For further changes, the child theme is located here: wp-content\themes\crework-child 
and parent theme here: wp-content\themes\crework-parent






Styling:
I have added SASS to the WordPress child theme. We have used VS code as it supports SASS development. I then created File watcher so it detects for the changes in the SASS file and changes the output CSS automatically. I modified parent's theme to style the website according to the requirements provided by client.
