 ## Name : Simran Kishin Mulchandani ##
I got the opportunity to work on a project with a Real Industry client and develop my interests and dedication. 
This project has given me exposure to real-world skills as I had to develop and deploy a WordPress website for 
Ashlea Kellner, my client who owns Santai Pottery & Art studio. The pottery studio is where she makes pottery 
and sells it. She also rents her space to the tenants to run creative workshops. I created the Website Santai 
Pottery & Art studio by interviewing the client and the requirements given by her. Through the website, she can
display her unique suburban space to the people. I have built a platform where people can book their classes and
participate in her or other tenants' events. Also, I have integrated a payment gateway through which she can 
receive payments online. Website design plays an important role in developing a website to attract customers as
it is the first thing customers view on the website. It should be user-friendly and easy to access. To grow a 
business through a website it is important to have a responsive website for better sales. This was my main goal 
while developing this website. So it helps my client's business grow along with fulfilling her requirements on 
the website. The Content Management service that I have used for this website is WordPress. While designing and 
developing are important for a website but without testing, it is not possible to have the desired website. For 
local development and testing of the website, I have used Vagrant VVV. For the deployment of my WordPress website,
I have used LightSail.I have created a dynamic website using a child theme for the client to use the website easily.
I have installed plugins like W3cache that will help dramatically increase the speed and user experience of the 
website, then a Search Engine Optimization plugin to optimize rankings and traffic of the website. Through this project
and Content management course I have learned how to use WordPress themes, and development environments, install plugins,
and how to create a child theme. Also, I have developed skills in how to use AWS services, managing project on GitHub
projects, and use VVV vagrant. This project has helped me enhance my skills in PHP, and HTML and learn about SASS. 
That is a great addition to my skills as it helps save time and was convenient to create and edit the CSS for the website
design.
