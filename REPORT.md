 ## Name : Simran Kishin Mulchandani ##
I recently got the opportunity to work on a project with a Real Industry client and I am very proud of the results. 
This report is to showcase the website that gave me exposure to real-world skills as I had to develop and deploy 
a WordPress website for Ashlea Kellner, my client who owns Santai Pottery & Art studio. The pottery studio is where 
she makes pottery and sells it. She also rents her space to the tenants to run creative workshops. I created the Website Santai 
Pottery & Art studio by interviewing the client and the requirements given by her. Through the website, she can
display her unique suburban space to the people. I have populated the website with content, including product descriptions, images,
and pricing information. I also created a contact form to allow customers to reach out directly to the owner.
Also, I have integrated a payment gateway through which she can receive payments online. Website design plays an important role in 
developing a website to attract customers as it is the first thing customers view on the website. It should be user-friendly and easy to access. 
The goal of the website was to showcase the studio's products and services and to attract more potential customers. So it helps my client's business grow along with 
fulfilling her requirements on the website. The Content Management service that I have used for this website is WordPress. While designing and 
developing are important for a website but without testing, it is not possible to have the desired website. For 
local development and testing of the website, I have used Vagrant VVV. For the deployment of my WordPress website,
I have used LightSail.I have created a dynamic website using a child theme for the client to use the website easily.
I have installed plugins like W3cache that will help dramatically increase the speed and user experience of the 
website, then implemented a Search Engine Optimization plugin to optimize rankings and to ensure the website was easy to find in search engine results.
During the project and Content management course, I developed skills in website design, development, SEO, to use WordPress themes, use development environments,
install plugins,and create a child theme. Also, I developed skills in how to use AWS services, managing project on GitHub
projects, and use VVV vagrant. Developing this website enabled me to further hone my skills in PHP, CSS, HTML and learn about SASS. 
That is a great addition to my skills as it helps save time and was convenient to create and edit the CSS for the website
design.
